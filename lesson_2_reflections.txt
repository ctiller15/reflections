"What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
"
It initializes an empty git repository. I need to do this because it will allow me to commit my files in the future.

"How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What do you think it offers?"

- The working directory is just where you currently are. It is where your files initially exist, and the git repository is where your final changes are recorded.

The staging area serves as an in-between to make some final adjustments before you commit your change.
