"When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?"

-I would want to create a remote repository if I'm in a situation where I'm not working on a device that I own, so I could still have access to my files after my work is done.

- I would want a remote repository in any situation that involves collaboration, so others can take and modify the document themselves.

- If I'm in a situation where I'm at risk of losing data on my machine for whatever reason. Backing up your files in multiple places isn't exactly a bad move in most cases.

"Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?"

-An odd question. If I pull changes manually then I have more control over what files I want to work with.

- If it always stays up to date with just my remote repository, then collaboration becomes a bit of a mess. We would have no real way of deciding which files automatically show up on github.

- It's easier when collaborating, to branch and pick/choose the important commits.
