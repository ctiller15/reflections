"When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?"

-I would want to create a remote repository if I'm in a situation where I'm not working on a device that I own, so I could still have access to my files after my work is done.

- I would want a remote repository in any situation that involves collaboration, so others can take and modify the document themselves.

- If I'm in a situation where I'm at risk of losing data on my machine for whatever reason. Backing up your files in multiple places isn't exactly a bad move in most cases.

"Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?"

-An odd question. If I pull changes manually then I have more control over what files I want to work with.

- If it always stays up to date with just my remote repository, then collaboration becomes a bit of a mess. We would have no real way of deciding which files automatically show up on github.

- It's easier when collaborating, to branch and pick/choose the important commits.

"Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?"

- A fork is essentially when you take a version of a github repository and make it into your own repository. It's almost like cloning, but exists solely on github. It's good for if you want to create your own version of the project, or work on a version of the project with your own team.

- A clone is a copy of the github repository on your local machine. It's good for if you want to work on the project without pushing your changes to it, or if you're working on a project with a team and don't want to mess with the main project until something is completed.

- A branch is like a section of the project, based on the original. It has the same commit history as the original master branch, but it's a way to continue forward in another direction without affecting the original document. It's very good for testing out new features.

"What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?"

- The biggest benefit I can think of is if you for whatever reason do not have internet access, this allows you to keep working on your file and then merge it back with your remote on github.
